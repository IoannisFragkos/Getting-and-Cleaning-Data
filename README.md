# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
## Repo with course assigment material

**This repo contains the following files:**

- **run_analysis.R**:   File that downloads the assignment dataset, cleans it and outputs a tidy_data.csv file and a merged.csv file, as required in part 5.

- **tidy_data.csv**:    File with tidy data, that contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject, as explained in the assignment.

- **codebook.pdf**:      Codebook file that explains the choices made when cleaning the data, and their brief description.

- **run_analysis.pdf**:  compiled document with results, created with knitr

Note that the file merged.csv is not submitted due to space limitations, but it can be readily reproduced by running the script `run_analysis.R`
